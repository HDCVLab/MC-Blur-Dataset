## Dataset Reproduce Instruction

MC-Blur Benchmark consits of four different subsets, i.e., Real high-fps based Motion-blurred subset (RHM), large-kernel UHD Motion-blurred subset (UHDM), large-scale heavy defocus blurred subset (LSD), and Real Mixed Blurry Qualitative subset (RMBQ).
Among them, the blurry images in RHM and UHDM subsets are synthesized by us and the blurry images in LSD and RMBQ are captured in the real world. 
Specifically, to synthesize the blurry images in RHM, we follow the work [1]  and we average 9-13 successive frames from 250 fps set, 19-25 successive frames from 500 fps set, and 37-51 successive frames from 1000 fps to produce blurry images, respectively. 
For UHDM, we synthesize degraded images caused by motion blurs is to convolve
images with larger kernels [2]. We show some code in the following.



## Some steps for synthesizing RHM and UHDM dataset

## RHM
- Random select number of successive frames in the sharp video sequences (9-13 for 250 fps set, 19-25 for 500 fps set and 31-51 for 1000 fps set).

- Follow [work](https://github.com/handong1587/PSF_generation) [1] to generate blurry images.


## UHDM 

- Download the [code](https://github.com/handong1587/PSF_generation)

- Set the size of blur kernels and generate blurry images from sharp images of UHDM dataset
